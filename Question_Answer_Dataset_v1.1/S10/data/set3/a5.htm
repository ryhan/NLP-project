<br />
<br />Jakarta (also DKI Jakarta) is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. Located on the northwest coast of Java, it has an area of   and a population of 8,490,000.  Jakarta is the country&apos;s economic, cultural and political center. It is the most populous city in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and is the twelfth-largest city in the world. The metropolitan area, Jabodetabek, is the second largest in the world. Jakarta is listed as a global city in the 2008 Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC) research.    the city&apos;s name is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Jayakarta&quot; (जयकर्) which translates as &quot;victorious deed,&quot; &quot;complete act,&quot;or &quot;complete victory.&quot;
<br />
<br />Established in the fourth century, the city became an important trading port for the Kingdom of Sunda. It grew as the capital of the colonial Dutch East Indies. It was made capital of Indonesia when the country became independent after World War II. It was formerly known as Sunda Kelapa (397–1527), Jayakarta (1527–1619), Batavia (1619–1942), and Djakarta (1942–1972).
<br />
<br />Landmarks include the National Monument and Istiqlal Mosque. The city is the seat of the ASEAN Secretariat. Jakarta is served by the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport, and Tanjung Priok harbour; it is connected by several intercity and commuter railways, and served by several bus lines running on reserved busways.

<br />
<br />The Jakarta area was part of the fourth century Indianized kingdom of Tarumanagara. In AD 39, King Purnawarman established Sunda Pura as a new capital city for the kingdom, located at the northern coast of Java.    Purnawarman left seven memorial stones across the area with inscriptions bearing his name, including the present-day Banten and West Java provinces.    After the power of Tarumanagara declined, its territories, including Sunda Pura, became part of the Kingdom of Sunda. The harbour area was renamed Sunda Kalapa as written in a Hindu monk&apos;s lontar manuscripts.  Bujangga Manik Manuscript which are now located at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University in England, and travel records by Prince Bujangga Manik.( )  By the fourteenth century, Sunda Kelapa became a major trading port for the kingdom. The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 when the Portuguese were looking for a route for spices, especially black pepper.
<br />
<br />The Kingdom of Sunda made a peace agreement with Portugal by allowing the Portuguese to build a port in 1522 in order to defend against the rising power of the Sultanate of Demak from central Java.   
<br />In 1527, Fatahillah, a Sumatran Malay warrior from Demak attacked Kingdom of Sunda and succeeded in conquering the harbour on June 22, 1527, after which Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta.

<br />
<br />Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta from the Sultanate of Banten, Dutch ships arrived in Jayakarta in 1596. In 1602, the British East India Company&apos;s first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the center of British trade in Indonesia until 1682.
<br />
<br />Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.    When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, Jayawikarta&apos;s soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. Prince Jayakarta&apos;s army and the British were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen (J.P. Coen). The Dutch burned the English fort, and forced the English to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power and in 1619 they renamed the city &quot;Batavia.&quot;

<br />
<br />Commercial opportunities in the capital of the Dutch colony attracted Indonesian and especially Chinese immigrants, the increasing numbers creating burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. On 9 October 1740, 5,000 Chinese were massacred and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.    The city began to move further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 encouraged more people to move far south of the port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913,   and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area.  By 1930 Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,  Colonial Economy and Society, 1870-1940. Source: U.S. Library of Congress.  including 37,067 Europeans.

<br />
<br />The Japanese renamed the city &quot;Jakarta&quot; during their World War II occupation of Indonesia. Following World War II, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from allied-occupied Jakarta during their fight for Indonesian independence and established their capital in Yogyakarta. In 1950, once independence was secured, Jakarta was once again made the national capital.  Indonesia&apos;s founding president, Sukarno, envisaged Jakarta as a great international city. He instigated large government-funded projects undertaken with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.       Projects in Jakarta included a clover-leaf highway, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, major hotels, shopping centre, and a new parliament building.
<br />
<br />In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt which saw 6 top generals killed, and ultimately resulted in the downfall of Sukarno and the start of Suharto&apos;s &quot;New Order. A propaganda monument stands at the place where the general&apos;s bodies were dumped. In 1966, Jakarta was declared a &quot;special capital city district&quot; (daerah khusus ibukota), thus gaining a status approximately equivalent to that of a state or province.    Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as Governor from the mid-60&apos;s commencement of the &quot;New Order&quot; through to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built several hospitals, and a large number of new schools. He also cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects some for the benefit of the Suharto family       and tried to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city in order to stem the overcrowding and poverty. 
<br />   Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom which changed the face of the city.
<br />
<br />The boom ended with the 1997/98 East Asian Economic crisis putting Jakarta at the center of violence, protest, and political maneuvering. Long-time president, Suharto, began to lose his grip on power. Tensions reached a peak in the Jakarta riots of May 1998, when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces; four days of riots and violence ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings.    The Jakarta riots targeted Chinese Indonesians.  Wages of Hatred. Michael Shari. Business Week.  Suharto resigned as president, and Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia.    Jemaah Islamiah-connected bombings have occurred in the city since 2000 on an almost annual basis,   although the 2009 bombing of two international hotels was the first since 2005.

<br /><h2> Kota or Kotamadya (Cities) of Jakarta </h2>
<br />Map of the Cities (Kotamadya) of DKI Jakarta. Each Cities are divided into Subdistricts (Kecamatan)
<br />
<br />Officially, Jakarta is not a city, but a province with special status as the capital of Indonesia. It has a governor (instead of a mayor), and is divided into several sub-regions with their own administrative systems. As a province, the official name of Jakarta is Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta (&quot;Special Capital City District of Jakarta&quot;), which in Indonesian is abbreviated to DKI Jakarta.
<br />
<br />Jakarta is divided into five kota or kotamadya (&quot;cities&quot; - formerly municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one regency (kabupaten) headed by a regent. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first ever election to choose a governor, whereas previously the city&apos;s governors were appointed by local parliament. The poll is part of a country-wide decentralization drive, allowing for direct local elections in several areas.
<br />
<br />The Cities/Municipalities of Jakarta are:
<br />* Central Jakarta (Jakarta Pusat) is Jakarta&apos;s smallest city and home to most of Jakarta&apos;s administrative and political center. It is characterized by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), the Istiqlal Mosque, and museums.   
<br />* West Jakarta (Jakarta Barat) has the highest concentration of small-scale industries in Jakarta. The area includes Jakarta&apos;s Chinatown and landmarks include the Chinese Langgam building and the Toko Merah building. West Jakarta contains part of the Jakarta Old Town.   
<br />* South Jakarta (Jakarta Selatan), previously planned as a satellite city, is now the location of large upscale shopping centers and affluent residential areas. Jakarta Selatan functions as Jakarta&apos;s ground water buffer,  but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Most CBD area of Jakarta is concentrated in South Jakarta. 
<br />* East Jakarta (Jakarta Timur) territory is characterized with several industrial sectors erected in this city.  There is also still some area of swamps and rice fields in this city. 
<br />* North Jakarta (Jakarta Utara) is the only city in Jakarta that is bounded by the sea (Java Sea). It is the location of the Tanjung Priok Port. Big-scale and medium-scale industries are concentrated in North Jakarta. North Jakarta contains the location of Jakarta Old Town, formerly known as Batavia since the 17 th  century, and was a center of VOC trade activity in Dutch East Indies. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (Taman Impian Jaya Ancol), currently the largest integrated tourism area in South East Asia.
<br />
<br />The only Regency (Kabupaten) of Jakarta is:
<br />
<br />* Thousand Islands (Kepulauan Seribu), formerly a subdistrict of North Jakarta, is a collection of 105 small islands located on Java Sea. It has a high conservation value because of its unique and special ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycle, and wind surfing, is the most important touristic activities in this territory. The main transportation between these islands are speed boat or small ferries.
<br />
<br /><h2> Government </h2>
<br />Since September 1945, the governmental of Jakarta City has been changed from the Japanese Djakarta Toku-Betsu Shi into Jakarta National Administration. This first government was held by a Mayor until the end of 1960 when it was changed into a Governor. The last Mayor of Jakarta is Sudiro, until he was replaced by Dr. Sumarno as a Governor.
<br />
<br />In 1974, Based on the Act No. 5 of 1974 about Fundamental of Regional Government, Jakarta was stated as the Capital City of Indonesia and part of the 26 Province in Indonesia.

The most important river is the Ciliwung River, which divides the city into the western and eastern principalities.
<br />
<br />The northern part of Jakarta lies on a plain, approximately eight meters above the sea level. This contributes to the frequent flooding. The coastal area extends around   from west to east. The southern parts of the city are hilly. During the wet season, Jakarta suffers from flooding due to clogged sewage pipes and waterways, deforestation near rapidly urbanizing Bogor and Depok, and the fact that 40% of it is below sea level .

<br /><h1> Culture </h1>

<br />
<br />As the economic and political capital of Indonesia, Jakarta attracts many domestic immigrants who bring their various languages, dialects, foods and customs.
<br />
<br />The Betawi (Orang Betawi, or &quot;people of Batavia&quot;) is a term used to describe the descendants of the people living in and around Batavia and recognized as an ethnic group from around the 18th-19th century. The Betawi people are mostly descended from various Southeast Asian ethnic groups brought or attracted to Batavia to meet labor needs, and include people from parts of Indonesia. The Betawi - due to their diverse origins - play a major role concerning ethnic and national identity in contemporary Jakarta; see Knörr, Jacqueline: Kreolität und postkoloniale Gesellschaft. Integration und Differenzierung in Jakarta, Campus Verlag: Frankfurt a.M. &amp; New York, 2007, ISBN 978-3-593-38344-6  The language and the culture of these immigrants is distinct from that of the Sundanese or Javanese. The language is more based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic. Nowadays, the Jakarta-dialects used by people in Jakarta are loosely based on the Betawi language.

<br />
<br />Betawi arts are rarely found in Jakarta due to their infamous low-profile and most Betawi have moved to the border of Jakarta, displaced by new immigrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang based wedding ceremonial instead of Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese Gamelan instead of Gambang Kromong (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music) or Tanjidor (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music) or Marawis (a mixture between Betawi and Yaman music). However, some festivals such as the Jalan Jaksa Festival or Kemang Festival include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to give performances.
<br />
<br />There has also been a Chinese community in Jakarta for many centuries. Officially, they make up 6% of the Jakarta population, though this number may be under-reported.
<br />
<br />Jakarta has several performing art centers, such as the Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art center in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some Provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Traditional music is often found at high-class hotels, including Wayang and Gamelan performances. Javanese Wayang Orang performance can be found at Wayang Orang Bharata theater near Senen bus terminal. As the nation&apos;s largest city and capital, Jakarta has lured much national and regional talent who hope to find a greater audience and more opportunities for success.
<br />
<br />Jakarta is hosting several prestigious art and culture festivals as well as exhibitions, such as the annual Jakarta International Film Festival (JiFFest), Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival, Jakarta Fashion Week, Jakarta Fashion &amp; Food Festival (JFFF), Flona Jakarta (Flora and Fauna exhibition, held annually on August in Lapangan Banteng park featuring flowers, plant nursery, and pets), also Indonesia Creative Products and Jakarta Arts and Crafts exhibition. The Jakarta Fair is held annually from mid June to mid July to celebrate the anniversary of the city. It is largely centered around a trade fair, however this month-long fair also has featured entertainments, arts and music performances by local bands and musicians.
<br />
<br />Several foreign art and culture centers also established in Jakarta, mainly serve to promote culture and language through learning centers, libraries, and art galleries.

<br />
<br />In 2005, Jakarta&apos;s contribution to the national GDP was 17% up from 15% in 2000.

In 1971, rickshaws were banned from major roads, and shortly thereafter the government attempted a total ban, which substantially reduced their numbers but did not eliminate them.  A campaign to eliminate them succeeded in 1990 and 1991, but during the economic crisis of 1998, some returned amid less effective government attempts to control them. Azuma, Yoshifumi (2003).
