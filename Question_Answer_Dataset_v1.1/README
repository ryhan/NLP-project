Question/Answer Dataset, Release 1.1
====================================

This is the README file for the Question/Answer dataset generated by students 
who took undergraduate natural language processing courses taught by Noah Smith 
at Carnegie Mellon and Rebecca Hwa at the University of Pittsburgh during 
Spring 2008, Spring 2009, and Spring 2010.

There are three directories, one for each year of students: S08, S09, and S10.

The file "question_answer_pairs.txt" contains the questions and answers. The first line of the file contains 
column names for the tab-separated data fields in the file. This first line follows:

ArticleTitle    Question        Answer  DifficultyFromQuestioner        DifficultyFromAnswerer  ArticleFile

Field 1 is the name of the Wikipedia article from which questions and answers initially came.
Field 2 is the question.
Field 3 is the answer.
Field 4 is the prescribed difficulty rating for the question as given to the question-writer. 
Field 5 is a difficulty rating assigned by the individual who evaluated and answered the question, 
which may differ from the difficulty in field 4.
Field 6 is the relative path to the prefix of the article files. html files (.htm) and cleaned 
text (.txt) files are provided.

Questions that were judged to be poor were discarded from this data set.

There are frequently multiple lines with the same question, which appear if those questions were answered 
by multiple individuals. 

This particular release was prepared by Kevin Gimpel, but the data collection process 
was performed by Noah Smith, Mike Heilman, Rebecca Hwa, Shay Cohen, and many CMU students 
and Pitt students.
